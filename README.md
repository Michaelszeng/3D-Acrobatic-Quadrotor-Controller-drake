## Technical Achievements
 - Performs trajectory optimization from any starting pose to any goal pose over a fixed horizon, using Iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithm (also known as Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)). Particularly worthy of note is that this algorithm solves a highly non-convex problem using only convex optimization (to a local minima), penalizing error in all 6 degrees of freedom, which is not possible with other popular works that use polynomial parameterizations of the trajectory and the differential flatness property of quadrotors [1]. Simply explained, iLQR solves the optimal trajectory `(x(t), u(t)` iteratively; each iteration, it analyticaly solves the Bellman Equation using a local linear approximation of the quadrotor dynamics and quadratic approximation of the cost function around the current guess of `(x(t), u(t)` to derive an improved control-input trajectory `u(t)`, then applies `u(t)` to the quadrotor's true dynamics to arrive at a new guess of the state trajectory `x(t)`. This process repeats until convergence.
 - Accurately tracks the optimal trajectory using a nearly globally stable geometric controller, which is not subject to linearization errors like with a simple LQR. We effectively re-implementat the seminal work on quadrotorc control [2].

## Future work: 
- Improve the iLQR cost formulation as trajectories tend to be too aggressive and prefer straight lines
- Tuning the Geometric SE(3) controller
